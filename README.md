# Using the IOTA Framework to balance the PV energy generation using AVs
This is the basis of my Masters project

The general idea is: 
- PV collectors generate power during the day
- If too much power is generated, the PV collectors have to be switched off to keep the grid balanced
- In the future, we will have AVs (autonomous vehicles) can act as energy storage buffers when energy production is peaking
- The IOTA framework can be used as a means of P2P communication and value transfer in a M2M economy
